Implementing a Binary Search Tree

## Project Description
* Task 1: Parse a Text File and Build a Binary Search Tree
The file Shakespeare.txt is present in this repository. Write a piece of software which reads in the text file and parses from it the entirety of Shakespeare’s Sonnets (beginning on line 253, ending on line 2867). Parse only the words of the Sonnets, not numbers. Build a Binary Search Tree from the parsed words, allowing duplicate nodes where a word appears more than once.
* Task 2: Finding a Word and Determining 66 Most Frequently Used Words
 Having constructed your Binary Search Tree, you shall write two functions:
o A function which will search the Tree for a user-specified word and returns
the number of times the word appears in the Tree. Efficiency of this search
will affect mark awarded.
* Task 3: A function which searches the Tree to determine the 66 most commonly used words in Shakespeare’s Sonnets, excluding ‘the’ and ‘a’. It will proceed to
print these 66 words to screen in alphabetical order.
